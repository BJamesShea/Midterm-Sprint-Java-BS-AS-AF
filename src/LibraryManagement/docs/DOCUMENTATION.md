## Introduction
This Library Management System was developed to simplify the process of managing library resources, including books,
periodicals, authors and patrons.

Provides an efficient way to catalog items, manage borrowing and returns, and keep track of patrons. 

Designed for both library staff and customers!

We had a lot of fun developing this, the instructions were clear and concise!

**Designed for Cohort 11's Semester 3 Java Midterm, by Brandon Shea, Adam Stevenson and Angie Flynn.**
